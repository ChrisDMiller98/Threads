I am not sure I have ever been more lost on an assignment. The List<> confused me,
accessors confused me, the wording of the instructions confused me, and
threads in general confused me. No matter how much I adjusted, whenever I added
code that I thought shoudl have worked from reliable sources or even you
my code lit up like a Christmas tree.
I would be surprised if anything was close to correct if I were to be 
honest. I apolagize once again that you have to look through this..
